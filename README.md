## How to check the authenticity of a wallet?

The public methods that are offered on the Internet make me doubt.<br>
Sending coins to an address is a stupid action.

I will share with you my working method of verification.

1. You need to install Bitcoin core, download all the blocks (this is more than 600 GB of files)<br>
2. Add and index the wallet. On a fast SSD, indexing one wallet will take 4-6 hours.

In the downloaded wallet, open the "Receive" tab and look at the list of addresses.<br>
On the left side (timings) is the time the address was created.<br>
To be sure, click on the address and check the first transaction in the blockchain.<br>
It should be after the address was created (from several hours to several days)

If there are no addresses in the "Receive" tab - THIS IS A FAKE WALLET!<br>
Scammers who replace an address in a wallet with another do not know how to replace the timings of the creation (generation) of the address.<br>
To hide the discrepancy between the timing and the address, they delete the address from the tab.

Also pay attention to the hash from the wallet. At the end of the hash there is an iteration counter.

Old wallets 10 years or more have 19,000 - 32,000 iterations.

If there are more than 32k iterations, this is a modern wallet.<br>
If more than 100k+, this is a fresh wallet.<br>
I would recommend that you put all wallets that are not in the range of 19,000 - 32,000 iterations in the questionable (suspicious) section.

I checked all my wallets this way.

Only 86 wallets passed all checks.
