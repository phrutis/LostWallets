# Please do not write me your questions about wallet.dat
# I gave the files for free, study, try, brute-force, do whatever you want...
# I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC OF WALLET.DAT!<b><br>

BONUS - A large unsorted Bitcoin archive of more than 10,000 wallets.dat
Unpacked 10.06 GB (11.4 GB)<br>
The archive also contains wallets of other coins, many extracted dumps for analysis, hashes for brute forcing, tools, scripts, ckey, mkey comparison tables and much more.<br>
Many wallets have duplicates, an earlier version, from another source, not indexed, etc.<br>

## How to check the authenticity of a wallet?

The public methods that are offered on the Internet make me doubt.<br>
Sending coins to an address is a stupid action.

I will share with you my working method of verification.

1. You need to install Bitcoin core, download all the blocks (this is more than 600 GB of files)<br>
2. Add and index the wallet. On a fast SSD, indexing one wallet will take 4-6 hours.

In the downloaded wallet, open the "Receive" tab and look at the list of addresses.<br>
On the left side (timings) is the time the address was created.<br>
To be sure, click on the address and check the first transaction in the blockchain.<br>
It should be after the address was created (from several hours to several days)

If there are no addresses in the "Receive" tab - THIS IS A FAKE WALLET!<br>
Scammers who replace an address in a wallet with another do not know how to replace the timings of the creation (generation) of the address.<br>
To hide the discrepancy between the timing and the address, they delete the address from the tab.

Ex valid wallet<br>

ex fake wallet<br>
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0348fdad-16e7-4215-a5bf-4edb47c77224)

Also pay attention to the hash from the wallet. At the end of the hash there is an iteration counter.

Old wallets 10 years or more have 19,000 - 32,000 iterations.

If there are more than 32k iterations, this is a modern wallet.<br>
If more than 100k+, this is a fresh wallet.<br>
I would recommend that you put all wallets that are not in the range of 19,000 - 32,000 iterations in the questionable (suspicious) section.

I checked all my wallets this way.

Only 86 wallets passed all checks.

### Wallet Hints
I hope there are no idiots trying to pick a password to wallet.dat?<br>
All these wallet.dat files are garbage!<br>
Do you really think that you were given a wagon of dollars, just pick the password to the lock and the money is yours)<br>
Not even a wagon, but a train with wagons)<br>
I understand that you want to dream that when you open it, you will become a billionaire, but the reality is completely different.<br>
These and all other files on the Internet are created to sell them and make money on those who buy them.<br>
People buy because human greed takes over their reason.<br>
Ask yourself why sell wallets with money, why don't they look for millions of dollars themselves???<br>
If they are real, opening one they will become fabulously rich.<br>
Complex passwords are not the answer. The hints look especially funny, this is just the peak of idiocy. <br>
As paradoxical as it is, there are people who believe in it. <br>
This file is from the logs, here is a screenshot, language en password length 10 + hints - this is for children, funny.<br>
I collected all the files and gave them to you for free. <br>
Do with them what you want, search, dream of yachts and islands and girls.<br>
[Do not write me questions on this topic, do not waste my time!](https://github.com/phrutis/LostWallets#please-do-not-write-me-your-questions-about-walletdat)<br>
I will tell you that before you, 10,000+ people were looking for these files.<br>
Very experienced hunters, companies, miners, etc. were looking.<br>
Many of those who searched spent tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of dollars, but no one found anything and will never find anything!<br>
Even if you manage to pick up the password, you will get an error when decrypting.<br>
What if that wallet is empty, is there movement there???<br>
The addresses that are displayed do not correspond to private keys.
Example. I downloaded the old Bitcoin core, changed the time on the PC (set it to 1975), created a new wallet.<br>
There will be an address with timings of 1975, when Satoshi was still peeing under the table. In the file, change the address to any.<br> 
You can add an address of at least 100,000 BTC. Set a password of 100 characters. <br>
No one will open it, so they will not be able to prove that the file is fake. <br>
They sell it for $ 1000 to an idiot, then this file starts to walk from hand to hand and all over the Internet. <br>
Others, having received it for free, think that they are smarter than those who searched before him. <br>
Especially those who have new RTX 5090 cards, they think that passwords will be found by themselves from the power) <br>
But they do not think that brains, real password databases, rules, etc. are needed.<br>
Would you give your safe with money to someone for which you forgot the password? You would not even give away an empty safe.<br>
If you are ready to buy such files from me for a cent per piece, I will make you 100,000 pieces with your favorite amounts and timings, <br>
I can add your address upon request. When you transfer coins from this address everyone will scream, and the wallet 742.78585798.dat is empty, someone picked up the password before me, aaaa.<br>
**Don't waste your time, money and resources on nonsense.** <br>
**Search in [bip39scan](https://github.com/phrutis/bip39scan) there are real finds.**

P.S. Sorry for dispelling your goal to become a billionaire.
